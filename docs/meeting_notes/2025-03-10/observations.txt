Notes of observations before the meeting to potentially discuss

- "Work session" paradigm incompatible with current task assignment process
	- Programmers can communicate directly in the work session, meaning the task assignment process is unnecessary bureaucracy
		- The original purpose of the task assignment process is to facilitate "lone" development
- "unit" API documentation
	- It is important for users of Nodes (we, the developers) to know how to use them
	- Inputs, outputs
	- A function is not a unit
