Notes of observations before the meeting to potentially discuss

- "Work session" paradigm incompatible with current task assignment process
	- Programmers can communicate directly in the work session, meaning the task assignment process is unnecessary bureaucracy
		- The original purpose of the task assignment process is to facilitate "lone" development
- "unit" API documentation
	- It is important for users of Nodes (we, the developers) to know how to use them
	- Inputs, outputs
	- A function is not a unit
- Some other things that could be documented (to discuss):
	- Organization of godot files
	- Entity relationships
	- Overall game architecture
	- Gameplay loop
	- Process of figuring out "what do we do"
		- for example
			- 1. User stories: What the user wants to experience
			- 2. Requirements: What the software should accomplish
			- 3. Specifications: What the software should be
			- 4. Tasks: What to do to execute specifications
	- Work sessions
