* let's wing it
* I've kinda started writing the final report

	* A little too critical? (More "on a positive note.")
	* Oskari: "I write in a way that positives are expected, not praiseworthy"
* Planning final days:
	* Here, to consult programmers?
	* Separate work session?
	* Otto: No need for a separate meeting
* Goals to achieve until 2025-03-30 Sunday
	* Most met, except 1 trivial
