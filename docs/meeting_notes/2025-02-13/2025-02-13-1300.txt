Meeting 2025-02, Thursday, 13-14

Project idea selected: **Video Game**

**Concerns raised about developing a video game:**
	- Godot most likely engine to be used, everyone needs to familiarize themselves with it
	- Using an existing framework may not be "technical" enough for this course
	- Not necessarily *difficult*, but *more* work

**Video game brainstorming**
	- Needs to be 2D
	- Shopkeeper game
		- Something like "Papa's Pizzeria" where producing products is a core game mechanic
		- Alternatively, a simulator game where store management and data, economics more prominent
	- Something like 'Vampire Survivors'
	- Maybe some other ideas

**What to do next**
	- Specific topics may have more casual conversation
	- Throw out ideas for the game
		- Maybe even give examples or references
		- @Otto decided as project owner
	- Give Godot a try, discuss in #godot
	- No git-repositories yet

**Next meeting on 2025-02-17, Monday, 13**
