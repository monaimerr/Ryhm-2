1305 Session started, Maxim joins soon after


1307 Game idea
	genre: Platformer, top-down?
	shop-keeping?
		- serving customers as a store manager?
	probably singleplayer (multiplayer too ambitious)
1313	Godot as a game engine? seems simple from a programming perspective...
	Likely technical enough

1315
	GDScript dominant language, concern: relevant skill? Necessary?
	C/C++/C#

1318
	Webapp productivity app
	Easily expandable (game is too)
	Architecture: 2nd party hosts a main server

1322
	Story writing app idea
	defining relation types
	Needs expansion

1325
	game?
	productivity-app: difficult?
	story-app seems easiest

1326
	seven people
	story-idea too basic
	game project difficult, seven people might be possible
	not necessarily hard, more work
	game idea intriguing
	webapp difficult : synchronization
	webapp: employability, relevant to software in general
	story app is a novel idea; no previous references
	webapp if it turns out too complex

1340 video game vins
    project leader?
	Otto seems best candidate for a "project owner"
1343
	Vampire survivors game
	shopkeeper game?
	What if game is completed early?
		Can be expanded iteratively
1348
    Shopkeepergame
    	Something like papa's pizzeria
	Game exipmels
		Simulator games (goat, truck)
			2d shop simulator?
			maybe even expanding?
			NPCs
1354
	Shopkeeping more relatable to vampires
		but vampires are more flexible
		dopamine!!!
