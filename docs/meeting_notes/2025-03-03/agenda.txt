2025-03-03 1pm meeting
- means "planned topic"
# means "personal note"
* means "spontaneous topic", "came up during meeting"
> means "this topic is deferred"
! means "decision"
+ means "todo"

* everyone is here
- Is current scheduling unclear?
	# Eemeli was unsure about next meeting date
	* OSKARI MESSED UP
- So what's happened?
	- Work sessions?
	- Matilda's tileset?
		* Still working on it, ready today
- About GitHub Issues
	- Is it possible to "check in" work?
		# Not to an issue, but a task (subset of a task package)
		* Subissues?
	- Better alternatives
		# Recall: Small iterations, Clarity, low bureaucracy, self-staffed
		# Order of increasing complexity
		- A text file on the git repo?
			# Keep it simple, stupid
			# Personal preference
			# Reduces GitHub into a mere repository host
		* Commenting on github issues
		- An issue could be either a task package or a task
			# Oskari dislikes because it 
		- GitHub Projects?
			# Oskari looked at it, tried to make a project, no "new project" button
		- Any other ideas?
		* Opinions?
			* Important that it's synchronized and easy-to-use
			! Decision: use git repo text files
	- Continue as before or adopt new method?
- Alternative organizational idea:
	- text file primacy, git repo primacy
	- Idea of formal meeting "result types": Decisions, TODOs, ?Opinions?, ?Ideas?, ?Scheduling?
	# in docs folder, each meeting has a folder, results are sorted into text files
	# in docs folder, an "aggregate" of each (requires trudging through paperwork)
	- Opinions?
		* NOTIFICATIONS!!
		* Maxim did get a notification for assignment 1, not another?
		* Email notifications are cool, not spam though
		* Hypothetical procedure: task done, mark it done on todo docment, commit 
		* Notifications a big concern, don't jump the gun
		+ consider further
- Oskari's desire to rework organization
	- Is the organization changing too fast?
		# Then again, no *protocols* have yet been written down...
		* beginning of development, changes in procedure the expected mode of operation
	- Is Oskari micromanaging?
    * Don't wonder too much, too little experience
    * Bottleneck: no software development yet...
	* git todo text? or Github issues?
		* Otto: the clearest, simplest way
		* Eemeli: text files
		* Maxim: github issues simple too
		* Otto: but list of tasks...
		* Maxim: but subissues?
		* Oskari: suissues good idea, text file too broad/open
		* Otto: should I remake the current issues?
		! subissues!
- Should Oskari's meeting notes be viewable for everyone in the project?
	- Oskari has been slacking off, not doing meeting summaries
	# both managing a meeting and writing down everything discussed is hard ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
	- A more central problem?: decisions and TODOs not in a central place
	- No process diagram...
	* At least very convenient for learning diaries
	* Even scribbles are better than nothing
	! Oskari's personal meeting notes are to be made available to the team
	+
- Deciding on work sessions, right now?
	# In normal software development projects, "work sessions" is just 9-5 employment
	# The first work session might require an initial "push" from the general meeting
	# The first work session's members can then decide on a next meeting themselves
	- At least Oskari needs a work session
	* Oskari: (long spiel about commitment and initiative)
	* Eemeli: good idea
	+ Maxim and Oskari WS: 03-04 15
	* (work session smush smash)
	* Oskari: I'm hands off
	* (more work session wallaballa)
	* Otto & Matilda decided not to specify requirements for now
* next general meeting?
	* can happen with less frequency
	* Next Thursday or Monday?
	* After work sessions?
		* Friday recap?
		* 13 o'clock tradition :>
		* Maxim might not be able to make it
* remake GitHub Issues?
	* Edit if possible, recreate
	* Are tasks specific enough? Otto wants feedback
* Otto will make Godot directories in the repo
	* Folders for art assets, scenes, scripts
	* You may create subfolders if appropriate
