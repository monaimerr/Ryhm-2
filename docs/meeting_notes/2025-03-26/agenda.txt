2025-03-26 1300 (1pm) General Meeting

- Denis excused from the meeting

* 9-10 days since last general meeting
- Direction and speed of development
	- 'work week' is over, what have we achieved?
		- What did we set out to achieve?
		* nothing is specific...
		- What have we not achieved?
		* Otto
    		* The basic gameplay loop isn't there yet...
    		* We'll get there though
	- Should we specifically decide to write down goals and verify them?
		* Oskari: "it's nice to have 'units' of completion"
		* Otto: Well we do actually, the functional features list
		* Oskari: Yeah that'll work
		* Otto: I can keep it up to date myself
		* Otto: lots of features we don't have time for
		* Matilda: I'll update it
		* Otto: changes to requirements since we're short on time
	- Then, given the remaining time, what can we achieve?
		- What's in the backlog? What shall we select?
		* Let's write an explicit separate document!
		* Oskari: we misprioritized, "day-night cycle" and "open/close shop"
	- Evaporation of specific procedure?
		- Oskari feels "uncertain" and "without mechanism"
		- Should we "codify" or at least document the current procedure?
		* Oskari: I realized it's a little pointless to ask
		* Oskari: anything needs changing?
		* Maxim: No
		* Oskari: Ok I'll write down what we currently do

- Course Project Retrospection
	- Success criteria
		- One success criterion of a system is "behaves as defined" but we have no definitions
		* "Without obvious bugs"
		* "It's not a bug it's a feature!"
	- Oskari will compile final report
		* Oskari got the impression from the Lecturer's video that the report should be a written-down document
		* Include at least some game screenshots or showcase material
		* Is there a code review?
		* Oskari: The assessed item is not the product but the procedure
		* Maxim: So we didn't need to do anything? xddd
		* Oskari: They probably don't care about the "product" but "the verification of product requirements"
	- Have we achieved the requirements?
		* This is too early, let's review in the final general meeting
	- Do we have too many people?
		* Just to get feedback
		- Some people have a job they're good at and contribute a lot
		- Others not so much?
		* Mounaim: Well no, we weren't given that many tasks...
		* Eemeli: Yeah, same, the workload hasn't been equally balanced
		* Eemeli: Difficult to perfectly balance anyway
		* Oskari: A lot of time weas spent on learning tools instead of developing
	- What have we learned?
		* more feedback
		Oskari:
    		- Oskari at least learned to respect software development methodologies
				* I thought I'd go in "figure it out meanwhile"
				* Otto: It's been difficult
    		- Oskari also learned to note the training and experience of team members
				* Discomfort of "Am I doing this right?"
				* Time spent learning tools
		Eemeli:
			* Git from the commandline was new for me, the guide Oskari made helped a lot
			* Godot environment itself, I was sceptical but it turned out nice
			* Group work: Planning in a team, meetings, requirements, and so on
		Maxim:
			* I've learned a lot about Godot
			* I learned about git, specifically on the commandline
			* Software development process overall has been more educational this course than the previous software development course
				* Hierarchies good?
				* On the previous we were following orders, this time we had to think more
				* Oskari's issues with designing the process was educational
		Mounaim:
			* Newest thing was Godot environment
			* Our task management was professional
		Otto:
			* Mostly about software project processes
    			* The management is a lot harder than programming
				* Leadership and managing is difficult, frustrating
			* Godot too, I had to familiarize myself more with it because I was designated "the expert"
			* Git was confusing, but the guides helped
		Matilda:
			* I've been mostly doing drawing, so learned about tile grids, game art, sprites
			* A little about git and Godot
			* Creating requirements
			* Process of creating a bigger project coordinating people

- Negotiating next meeting time
	- Next weekend, or next wednesday?
	* Tighter coordination, or continue as usual? 
	* Wednesday 1pm not okay for Maxim
	* Maxim: Sunday ok, Monday not so much
	* Eemeli: Sunday 12-15 OK
	* Mounaim: Sunday 12 OK
	* Otto: OK
	* Matilda: OK
	* Maxim: 1pm would be preferrable
	* OK: Otto, Matilda, Eemeli, Mounaim
