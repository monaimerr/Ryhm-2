Godot tutorials
Otto should show us, previous experience

1313
Git? git bad?
Oh! git IDE integration!

1314
Git usable still on Windows

1317

1318

1319
Git/tooling is not really touched upon in the computer science degree

1320
sustainable ICT, harry karhu uses Linux, shows commands, doesn't really explain them much
would help a lot with job searching

1326
share interesting/useful godot resources
Otto joins!

1328
Ott, can you show how to work Godot?

1330
Do we want a player character?
Minecraft-like interaction
POV? probably top-down
2D, definitely

1332
Otto shows GOdot!

1335
"Show how to create a moving sprite?"

1405
Viewpoint?
Detachable camera?
Good to have in a large game world

1411
Preference for a player character
Ask teacher if Godot is okay

1415
Implementation plan:
	Objective? gameplay loop?!
