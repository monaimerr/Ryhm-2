Meeting 2025-02-10, Monday, 13-14

All members were present.

The following matters were discussed:

**Project ideas**
Largely, three kinds of project ideas were discussed:
 - A video game
 - A productivity app
 - A mind-map/interactive graph for storywriting

**Video game**
 - May be technically challenging (Engine, programming language, etc.)
 - Graphical scope limited to 2D
 - Godot is primary suggestion for video game engine
 - Godot uses C, C#, C++, GDScript
 - Other engines suggested: Unity (C#, JS), GameMaker (custom language), Processing (Java, Python), PyGame (Python)
 - Game genre not yet specified
 - Requires art assets
 - Minor concern over scope creep

**Productivity app**
 - Many existing applications to reference
 - Specific functionality variable (tracking nutrition, tasks, finances, etc.)
 - Easily divisible into parts, complexity can be added on-demand
 - Will likely be a webapp: cross-platform and mobile-friendly

**Storywriting tool**
 - A graph/mindmap/wiki for story writers to keep track of their stories
 - Facts and relationships visualized on a graph or mindmap or a hypertext entry

**Interim**
A project idea will be chosen on the next meeting. Until then, ideas should be developed and further specifics determined.
 - Whoever suggested an idea will be responsible for developing it
 - Implementation details should be decided (For a webapp, some web framework; for a game, a game engine and genre)
 - By the end of the next meeting, a project idea *must* have been decided

**Project implementation plan**
 - About 1.5 weeks of time left to submit
 - Exact submission requirements are vague
 - Our plan will likely be concise and to-the-point
 - Lecturer shouldn't complain about terseness if he didn't specify against it
 - Maybe 2, 5 pages
 - Should be checked with everyone
 - Will become more relevant once a project idea has been selected

The next meeting will be on **2025-02-13, Thursday, at 13**
