Notes for meeting 2025-02-20, 1315-1420

All team members were present.

**Implementation plan**
- We should have "core requirements" that are vague but can be iterated upon and specified (necessitates a "living" requirements document)
- Plan should not be too broad, but also not too specific
- Specifications for exact behavior of game elements should be available/reachable
- Procedures of game development should be clear

**Documentation**
- Important documentation will now be kept in the form of network-synchronized Word documents, shared via pinned links on the #docs channel
- #docs channel exists also for documenting changes to those documents 

**Commitments**
- If you need something done, or promise to do something, make a message in #schedule with a deadline. This is to help with committing to work in this project

Next meeting will be on 2025-02-22, Saturday, 3pm. See #schedule
