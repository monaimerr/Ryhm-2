1312
Bringing Denis L up to speed
probably shopkeeping game, using Godot

1315
Has anyone tried out Godot?

1317
Eemeli not present
Delay "implementation details" for later
Lets decide on the video game genre and ideas

1319
Maxim would rather have some exploration
A shopkeeping game could also have moving about
Video game engine for a static interface is overkill

1321
Does it makes sense to design the game as waterfall?
Weekly iterations

1322
Milestones?
Split into parts i.e. character movement, etc.

1323
Otto as project owner would accept ideas but "will be the final word"

1324
Prototyping and 'exploration'
Let's first decide on the core idea!!! DO not waste effort on useless prototypes

1325
Basics first as a foundation
Working system first before 'fun'

1327
"A good game" is a difficult task, an ideal but not a priority 

1328
What criteria for a game project?
Probably bug-free and "behaves as defined"

1329
OcularPudu is fine with "okay"

1330
A large part of how a game feels polished is visual design and sound desgin
Art person? assets cohesion?
Volunteers? OcularPudu?

1334
Tools like Krita, GIMP, even MS Paint

1335
Every group member should be present for deciding the core idea

1336
two core ideas:
	explo

1338
Mechanics vs Theme
Top down view? side view? Interfaces?

1341
Fundamental mode of interaction first?
Objection: We don't even know the core theme yet!

1342
Ideas about shopkeeping
	- Interacting with the store
	- Selling to customers

1343
Would be more interesting to have a character
Would be easier to have a static interface

1345
Theme! Shopkeeping: potionmaking shop, being a shopkeeper, machines to make different ingredients, custom potionmaking
Came up already a few times so must be a good idea
Could apply to drinks or other things!
Papa's pizzeria game? Too static
A static interface does not necessarily lower the technical ceiling

1350
Sound design!
But a late concern
Music? Some have some experience...
Stock effects are fine

1352
No big decisions, one guy missing...
Flesh out shopkeeping idea?
Ideas for gameplay mechanics, setting, art style
Only 10 days before deadline to plan submission!

A little meeting on 2025-02-18 Tuesday, 1pm, mby 15 minutes
	To discuss game ideas
	
A big meeting probably on 2025-02-22, Thursday, 1pm

Decision: Shopkeeping!
Probably locked in
