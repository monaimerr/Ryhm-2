Meeting 2025-02-17, Tuesday, 1310-1400

Eemeli was not present.

**Game ideas**
- **"Shopkeeping" was decided as the theme of the game** since it evoked more conversation, implying greater interest by the team
- A navigable world is preferred over a set of GUIs, being more interesting despite greater technical difficulty
- "Potionmaking" is a top candidate for sub-theme of the game, implying mechanics related to production of the sold goods

**Developing the game**
- Development should be iterative and not planned waterfall-style
- **As quality criteria, "software quality" is considered more important than "game quality".** In other words, the software should behave as-defined and with fewer bugs, rather than the game be fun or artistically cohesive
- For the time being, art/music/assets are not a concern

**Godot**
- Last meeting suggested people become acquainted with Godot, which did not happen
- An implementation detail, considered acceptable to delay

**Implementation plan**
- 10 days left at the time of meeting, 7 at the expected time of next formal meeting
- Someone should be selected to write the implementation plan

**A "little meeting" will be held on 2025-02-18 Tuesday, 13 (1pm)**, to discuss ideas for gameplay, theme, etc. Not an "official" meeting, join if you want to!

**The next "official" meeting will be on 2025-02-20, Thursday, 13 (1pm)**
